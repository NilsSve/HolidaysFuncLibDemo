# Demo for 'Library-HolidaysFuncLib'

The `cCalendarHolidays.pkg` contains all the basic holiday date functions.

Run the sample program `HolidaysFuncLibTest` to see how the holiday functions work.

In addition to the `cCalendarHolidays` package, there are also specific National Holidays Date Function Libraries that can be streamlined for each individual country.

See the collection of country-specific libraries in `CountryPackages.pkg`. Use these files as templates for developing your own country-specific holiday package.

The workspace also contains a database and a view for showing Nations of the World, providing all kinds of facts about all nations. This part is independent of the calendar holidays packages above.
