Holidays and Other Special Dates Library
The cCalendarHolidays.pkg contains all of the basic Holiday dates functions. 

Run the sample program HolidaysFuncLibTest program to see how the holiday functions work.
In addition to the cCalendarHolidays package, there are also specific National Holidays Date Function Libraries, that can be streamlined for each individual country. 

See the collection of country specific libraries in CountryPackages.pkg. Use those files as templates for developing your own country specific holiday package.

The workspace also contains a database and a view for showing Nations of the World. All kinds of facts about all nations in the world. This part is independent from the calendar holidays packages above.
