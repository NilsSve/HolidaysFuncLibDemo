<h1 id="demo-for-library-holidaysfunclib">Demo for
‘Library-HolidaysFuncLib’</h1>
<p>The <code>oCalendarHolidays.pkg</code> contains all the basic holiday
date functions. See the documentation near the top of
cCalendarHolidays.pkg for details on how the function library works.</p>
<p>Run the sample program <code>HolidaysFuncLibTest</code> to see the
‘Holiday Functions Library’ in action. The ‘Dates Functions Test’
tab-page shows a grid with build-in ‘Holidays and Other Important
Dates’. Enter a year in the lower part and press the ‘Call Function’
button to see the date the holiday/special day falls on. Enter an ISO-2
character country code in ‘Enter Value 2:’ to see the name of the
holiday/special day at the bottom of the view. Note that only a few
‘National Holiday’ packages are available at current. Those countries
can be seen in the grid at the lower-left of the view.</p>
<p>Note: If your country is missing from the lower-left grid, it is
really simple to create one! Just see the examples in
‘CountryPackages.pkg’ on how to do it.</p>
<p>On the ‘Calendar Test’ tab-page is a sample on making your own
calendar inclusive holiday/special day names. There is also a sample of
a generalized lookup list for holidays. Click the ‘Test Holiday Lookup
List’ button to see how it can be used to return any selection of
holidays.</p>
<p>In addition to the <code>oCalendarHolidays</code> package, there are
also specific ‘National Holidays Date Functions’ that is streamlined for
each individual country. At a bare minimum such a country packge returns
holiday names as a string.</p>
<p>See the collection of country-specific libraries in
<code>CountryPackages.pkg</code>. Use these files as templates for
developing your own country-specific holiday package.</p>
<p>The workspace also contains a database and a view for showing Nations
of the World, providing all kinds of facts about all nations. This part
is independent of the calendar holidays packages above.</p>
